# Task Management System

You are required to build a simplified version of a task management web application SaaS. The application should allow users to create, update, delete, and list tasks. Each task will have a title, description, due date, and status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done"). The application should support multiple users, with each user having their own set of tasks.

### Backend :
Typescript (Effect library : https://effect.website/) <br>

To locally run backend : <br>

- Install npm packages **npm install** in terminal <br>
- Write **npm start** in terminal <br>
### Test : 
Jest<br>
For run test simply write **npm test** in terminal



### Architecture :

- I divide codebase in modules for increase modularity. Each module has a specific responsibility, making it easier to understand and maintain the code.Modularity also promotes code reusability, as modules can be easily reused in different parts of the application or in future projects.<br>
- Each component (repository, service, controller, etc.) focuses on a specific aspect of the application's functionality.<br>
- Repository directory typically holds files responsible for database interaction.<br>
- Service directory contains business logic for specific function.<br>
- Controller directory contains files responsible for handling HTTP requests and generating HTTP responses.<br>
- Route directory defines API routes and connects them to controller methods.<br>
- Types directory contains TypeScript type definitions or interfaces related to tasks.<br> 
- Tests directory holds test suites for the application.

  #### Advantages of this architecture :

  - Modularity : Divided into separate modules, also it is resuable
  - Testability : The architecture promotes testability by separating business logic from external dependencies such as the database or HTTP layer. Unit tests can be written for individual modules such as services and controllers, while integration tests can verify interactions between modules.
  - Flexibility and Scalability :  New features can be added or existing ones modified without affecting other parts of the application.
  - Maintainability :  Promoting code organization and readability of code, With clear separation of concerns and well-defined module boundaries, developers can quickly locate and modify code related to specific functionalities.
  - Clarity and Consistency :  Developers can easily understand the structure of the application and know where to find specific functionalities.

### Implementation : 

We use typescript for implementing API<br>

Why Typescript not javascript : 

- JavaScript is a dynamic, loosely-typed scripting language primarily used for web development.
- While typescript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, which helps catch errors at compile time and improves code readability and maintainability.
- TypeScript code needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can run in a browser or Node.js environment.

Javascript : 
 ```
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}

console.log(greet("Alice"));
 ```

Typescript : 
```
function greet(name: string): string {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}

console.log(greet("Alice"));
```

We use functional programming with typescript.

Why Functional Programming : 

- Increased Readability : Functional Programming is often more readable because of its declarative nature.
- Modularity : Divided into multiple functions and also we can use it in another part of code also(Reusable).

For implement functional programming we use effect library of typescript which is pure typescript.<br>

#### Effect : https://effect.website/

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers easily create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs.<br>

Effect is an ecosystem of tools that help you build better applications and libraries. As a result, you will also learn more about the TypeScript language and how to use the type system to make your programs more reliable and easier to maintain.<br>

Typescript with Effect : 
```
import { Effect } from "effect"
Â 
const divide = (a: number, b: number): Effect.Effect<number, Error, never> =>
  b === 0
    ? Effect.fail(new Error("Cannot divide by zero"))
    : Effect.succeed(a / b)
```

Typical Typescript : 

```
const divide = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero")
  }
  return a / b
}
```

### API : 

- `POST /users`: Create a new user.
- `POST /users/:user_id/tasks`: Create a new task for the specified user.
- `GET /users/:user_id/tasks`: Retrieve all tasks for the specified user.
- `GET /users/:user_id/tasks/:task_id`: Retrieve a specific task for the specified user.
- `PUT /users/:user_id/tasks/:task_id`: Update a specific task for the specified user.
- `DELETE /users/:user_id/tasks/:task_id`: Delete a specific task for the specified user.
